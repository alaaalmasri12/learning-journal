# Computer Architecture and Logic
## how computer works
>machine helps us with with the thinking work there 4 tasks computers do
1. input
2. storage
3. processing
4. output
## whats makes a computer a computer

**input**: is the things you do that makes the computer do stuff for you
**storage and processing**: all this input store them in the memmory the computer
**output**:computer can show audio and video games or viritual realility 
takes information  rom the memmory and procssess it using algortims then it output it

## how do computers use ciricuts
ciricuts can be represnted by 0 and 1 computers uses tiny things called ciricuts
there are there types of logic gates   NOT,OR,AND
for example:
 `0 not-> 1`
 `1 not-> 0`
`0 and 0-> 0`
`0 and 1-> 0`
`1 or 0 ->1`
`1 or 1 ->1` 
there a a ciricut called adder that the add the sum of 2 values of course you 
use wires to connect 2 circiuts teh adder has 8 bit ciricuts
ex:
>we have 1001 transform it a value adder has 8 bit so
1 2 4 8
1 0 0 1
`the answer is 9`
