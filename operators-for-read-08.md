# Comparison and logical operators
Comparison and Logical operators are used to test for true or false.
what is an operator: a comparison operator is a binary operator that takes two operands whose values are being compared
How Can it be Used???
Comparison operators can be used in conditional statements to compare values and take action depending on the result:
### Logical Operators
1. > &&
2.  > ||
3. > !
# for loops
For loops, similar to while loops, are used to iterate through a sequence/array of data types
or objects So in programming, loops are used for reiteration - for repetition of tasks. A sequence 
of instructions are put together in the loop and they’re repeatedly executed. The last instruction 
(end of the loop) is followed by the first instruction all over again (beginning of the loop) till you
explicitly break out of it, or specify a condition to do so.
# while loop
while loop:while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition

#do while
do while statement creates a loop that executes a specified statement until the test condition evaluates to false
